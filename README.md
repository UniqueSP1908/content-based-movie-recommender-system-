## Installation

To use this recommender system, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, you will need to install the required dependencies by running the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage

To run the recommender system, execute the following command:

bash
python recommender.py
This will prompt you to enter a movie title. Based on the provided movie, the system will recommend a list of similar movies.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is the [MovieLens 20M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/). It contains movie ratings provided by users, along with movie metadata such as genre, director, and actors.

The dataset is not included in this repository. You can download it from the MovieLens website and place the relevant files in the `data` directory.

## Algorithm

The recommender system uses a content-based filtering algorithm to recommend movies. It computes the similarity between movies based on their attributes and recommends movies with the highest similarity scores.

## Results

The performance of the recommender system was evaluated using various metrics, such as precision, recall, and mean average precision. The results showed that the system provides accurate recommendations based on movie attributes.
